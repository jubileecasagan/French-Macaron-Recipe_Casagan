<h1 style="color:blue;">French Macaron Recipe</h1>

<h2 style="color:green">Ingredients:</h2>
<ul style="background-color: lightgrey;">
    <li>Egg Whites</li>
    <li>Cream of Tartar</li>
    <li>Superfine Sugar</li>
    <li>Fine Almond Flour</li>
    <li>Gel Food Coloring (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:green">Instructions:</h2>
<ol style="background-color: lightgrey;">
    <li>Add cream of tartar to your aged room temperature egg whites and beat until very soft peaks form. This takes a few minutes of beating.</li>
    <li>Now add your superfine sugar in 3 additions and beat until stiff glossy peaks form</li>
    <li>Then add your optional gel food coloring. It's important to add gel food coloring to the egg whites directly, instead of the finished macaron batter. </li>
    <li>Set your stiff egg whites aside.</li>
    <li>Sift the almond flour and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>In 3 separate additions, begin slowly folding in the beaten egg whites in a circular motion. I always eyeball the amount.</li>
    <li>After only 1 addition, the batter will be very thick and dry.</li>
    <li>The batter will begin to loosen up after you add the 2nd and 3rd addition.</li>
    <li>After that 3rd addition of egg whites, you're at the macaronage stage. You need to keep folding and deflating air until you reach the perfect consistency.</li>
